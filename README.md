This proyect allows you to keep track of the sales, products and available customers of a clothing store.

It was thought for stores that works in small cities where there is a possibility that customers do not pay at the moment of the sale, so an account is created in which there is a resgister of the ammount of money the customer owes and the money it has payd.

When a customer buys clothes, the sku of each product is introduced in order to know the price. Two prices are shown, one is if the customer pays with cash and the other one is if its pays with credit card or it will buy through the account.

If the customer pays with credit card or cash, the user must push the corresponding button and the sale finishes.

If the customer prefers to add the sale to the account, the user must push the button of account and enter the dni of the customer to know if the customer already exists in the data base. If exists, the user must push save and the sale finishes, if not, the user must add the customer to the data base. After this, the user can save the sale.

In order to see the customers that are in the data base, the user should goes to the tab "Customers". In that tab, besides seeing the customers'information, it is possible to add, edit or delete a customer. In this tab, is where the user must edit the information regards total pay when the customer pays part of what it owes.
